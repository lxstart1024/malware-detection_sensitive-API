# malware-detection_sensitive-API
This repo consists of the core code of our work, including the following two modules:
## Feature representation module
This folder encompasses the code required for representing both PM and MM features. Within the MM feature representation, you will find the pre-trained model used for MM feature extraction, the fine-tuning process of the model, as well as the code for extracting MM features using the fine-tuned model. The PM feature representation consists of the code used for extracting MM features utilizing the pre-trained model.
## Fusion & Classification module
This folder contains the code responsible for fusing PM and MM features and training a malware classifier.
